			<div style="font-size:1.35rem">So right now, the illustrations are just vectorized sketches done in Inkscape, but as my work on the novel progresses, I'll be really drawing out the panels, keeping them vector-based.

			<div style="font-size:1.35rem">On the development side, I'll more than likely <b>server-side render(SSR)</b> using <span style="color:#B4B897"><b>NextJS</b></span>. I've used the GreenSock (<span style="color:#B4B897"><b>GSAP animation library</b></span>) for some basic animation applied to the panels and the drag and drop functionality.</div>
